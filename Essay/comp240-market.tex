%Market Research on a network lobby system for a game.

\section{Introduction}
For my essay I aim to illustrate who the target market is for my lobby system component. Furemore how the use of networking in games increases the sales of the game.
For my project I am working for a BA team where I am creating a network lobby system that will help match make players before the game starts.

\section{Target Audience}
The target Audience for this product is people who like game such as Valkyria Chronicles and Frozen Synapse, and those who like to play games with friends.
