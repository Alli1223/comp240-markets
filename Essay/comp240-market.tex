\section{Introduction}
Firelock is a game being developed by R-LOC Studios. The game is a strategic turn based First Person Shooter (FPS) with a colorful art direction.


\section{Target Market}
The market for strategic turn-based multiplayer shooters is pretty small with only 2 popular games that have similar gameplay mechanics.
These games are Valkryia Chronicles and Frozen Synapse \cite{Valkyria, Frozen}.

 Both these games are fairly popular with Valkryia Chronicles having over 900,000\cite{Valkyria} in sales and Frozen Synapse with just over 700,000 \cite{Frozen}. The game Verdun is not similar in merchanics but has similar art style and setting and that had 600,000 sales \cite{verdun}.

There is also a large market for turn based strategy games E.g. Xcom 2\cite{xcom} which has almost 1.4M in sales and Sid Meier's Civilization V which has over 10M \cite{civV}.

\section{ Target Audience}
The main Target Audience for this product is people who like games such as Valkyria Chronicles and Frozen Synapse, furthermore those who like to play games with friends.
The demographic for the game would be males and females in the age range of about 12+. %Where did the age come from

Because the target audience is young and will generally not have a lot of disposable income, the game is priced at \pounds 7.99. 
This is almost half of what competing games are selling at (Valkyria Chronicles is \pounds 14.99 and Frozen Synapse is \pounds 18.99 \cite{Valkyria, Frozen}). 

One of the reasons why the game is priced so low is because we are a new company so we need to build a reputation before being able to charge more.

\section{Marketing} %Justify costs related to marketing, not how or why we need to promote the game (Reduce this section)
To help market the game R-LOC is planning to target Youtube and Twitch steamers and content creators to help gain interest in the game.
This is because streamers such as Yogscast have such a large audience they can significantly help the sales of a game \cite{Hoggins, Rose}.  To help encourage steamers to review the game, R-LOC is intending to create 3D models of in game objects, these 3D printed objects can be shipped to a small selection of streamers which will help draw attention to the game \cite{Rose}.

Furthermore R-LOC will use the traditional marketing angle of using social media advertising i.e. keeping an active and continually updated web presence. 
This also includes establishing their brand on Facebook and Twitter with regular development updates, this will help involve the community with the development of the game and help keep them invested for a longer period of time.

\section{Marketing Costs}

The total marketing cost for an indie game is estimated to be roughly \$50,000(\pounds 39,895.00) this covers branding, trailer website, social media, devblog and PR \cite{marketingGame}.
Branding will cost roughly \$7,000(\pounds 5,585.30) \cite{marketingGame}.
Trailer will cost roughly \$4,000(\pounds 3,191.60) \cite{marketingGame}.
Humble bundle store take 25\% \cite{HumblebundleFAQ} and steam and GOG take roughly 30\% \cite{ValveCut}.
